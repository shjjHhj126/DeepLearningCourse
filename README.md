- objectives: Image feature extraction, train dataset using at least 3 models  
- how to train a model and evaluate performance?
  - in hw1.ipynb, there are cells that initiate models (SGD_model, cat_model, mlp_model), which also includes model.fit(X,y) that trains models and model.predict(X), model.predict_proba(X) that predicts the results.
